Options include the following:
* Optionnally provide an image
   * The image can be used as a benner before the video is completely loaded
   * or as a replacement for the video on mobile devices
* Simple checkboxes to select your options:
   * Autoplay (starts the video when it is loaded)
   * Loop (retarts the video idefinitely)
   * Muted (mutes the sound by default)
   * Controls (show media controls)
   * Responsive (adjusts the video so it never is larger than its container)

Known issues:
The following issues have not been implemented due to lack of time, they may be one day implemented if there is enough interest or you can also submit pull requests.
* Currently only supports mp4 since it works on pretty much any recent browser
* Replacing the video with an image on mobile devices currently only works on Bootstrap enabled skins.
